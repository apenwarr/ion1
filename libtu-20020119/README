Libtu is a small utility library for programs written in C. Naturally,
libtu is free software under the "Artistic License". See the file
LICENSE for details.

To build the library, first edit system.mk to customize it for your
system if necessary. Then 'make depend && make'.
To install it run 'make install' (perhaps as root depending on
where you are installing it).

If you want to use it in your programs, you may try to figure out how
by reading the header files (include/*.h) and test programs (tester*.c).
Or you could try urging me to write some sort of a manual.

---

Libtu needs the functions asprintf and vasprintf. These do not
exist on most platforms. One implementation by Mark Martinec
is included in snprintf_2.2/ and is used by default. To use the
system's versions of these functions, if available, modify
system.mk.
