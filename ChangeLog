2002-02-06:
  * Added 'split_top "dir"' command.
  * Updated doc/function.txt
  * Applied the patch to implement input handlers, shortcuts
    and a vi-like command mode.
  * Updated the LICENSE file to the clarified version of the artistic
    license. (The license used to be the original artistic license.)

2002-02-04:
  * Command sequences fixed to use the proper frame when switching
    workspaces.
  * Old behaviour with respect to client-requested window size
    restored (i.e. force to frame size).
  * Added set_width/height/widthq/heightq commands. The versions with
    the q postfix take a value in [0,1] and the others take an integer
    value. The behaviour is obvious.
  
2002-01-22:
  * The 'FWARN':s in opt_default of the command sequence parser
    should have been normal 'warn':s for proper handling.

2002-01-20:
  * Oops. I broke something while hastily adding command
    sequences.

2002-01-19:
  * Applied a patch to have query_function finally support functions
    with arguments.
  * Fixed a possible problem with missing configuration files.
  * Complain and refuse to start if configuration files are
    missing or bindings are inadequate (not the above fix :-).
    Also attempt to view this complaint with xmessage.
  * Experimental: command sequences using the above mentioned
    patch.
    
2001-11-26:
  * Yet another focusing fix

2001-11-12:
  * If client-requested window size is small enough to fit the frame,
    respect it as some programs may e.g. hang otherwise. (By ICCCM
    programs should respect the size given to their windows by the
    window manager.)

2001-11-09:
  * Restore focus to a frame when the root window receives it.
  * The patch necessary to run the session management module
    new included.
  * Line editor entries always get pushed into history and not
    only modified entries.
  * An (empty) implementation of unload_modules for builds without
    module support was missing.
  * switch_ws_next_n/switch_ws_prev_n. These functions do not wrap
    around at last and first workspace unlike the versions that do
    not take the parameter n.

2001-11-01:
  * 'quote_next' command: sends next key press event to active client.

2001-10-25:
  * Some problems with certain programs solved
  * Switch to next client within frame on iconify request
  
2001-04-25:
  * Added missing functions to documentation

2001-04-19:
  * switch_ws_next/prev wrap around
  * Fixed a problem with some programs' popups

2001-04-01:
  * Unmap;map race condition fix.

2001-03-12:
  * Added CALL_ALT and the 'add_clientwin_alt' alternative hook.
  * Hook changes

2001-03-05:
  * transient_mode winprop

2001-03-04:
  * Changes for easier completion support in modules

2001-03-03:
  * system.mk options to disable module support on systems without
    dynamic linking support and/or dlopen and friends.
  * Added read_config_for

2001-03-02:
  * Enhanced timer support
  * Added goto_client_name
  * Experimental module support

2001-02-26:
  * Completion fix (for the case where all possible completions are
    duplicates).

2001-02-24:
  * Added rename_workspace patch.
  * Oops kind of fix in key.c

2001-02-16:
  * complete_file_with_path fix and complete normally if no
    completions found in $PATH.

2001-02-15:
  * Some ICCCM and other fixes to make some programs not break as
    badly.
  * Call setpgid(0, 0) before running a program.
  * Oops. A few missing lines were causing bad things to happen when
    trying to resize only frame on a workspace.

2001-02-13:
  * Applied patch to allow command completion (using $PATH) with
    query_exec.

2001-02-12:
  * Destroying the first workspace on a screen could cause a
    segfault.

2001-01-21:
  * Added 'stubborn' winprop --- ignore coordinates --- for use with
    badly behaving windows when CF_PLACEMENT_GEOM is enabled.

2001-01-20:
  * Frame ID management fixes for multiple screens/broken workspace
    configuration files.
  * The functions 'goto_*_frame' changed to 'goto_*' --- check your
    bindings.

2001-01-16:
  * goto_previous fix
  * Other previous active window clean-up

2001-01-15:
  * Added CF_PLACEMENT_GEOM kludge --- Place new windows that have
    position specified in the frame under that coordinate.

2001-01-05:
  * 'query_runwith' runs the program without arguments if the user
    inputs an empty string.
  * 'query_workspace_with' didn't work after multihead update.
  * Trailing and leading whitespace of user input to queries are
    stripped.
  * Strip trailing and leading whitespace from window names.

2001-01-02:
  * Preliminary support for multiple screens within single process.
  * The command 'switch_ws_nth <num>' switches between workspaces of
    current screen. 'switch_ws_nth2 <scr>, <num>' can be used to go
    to specific, numbered workspace. Setting <num> to -1 will go to
    active workspace on <scr>. 'query_workspace' works as before (new
    workspace is, of course, created on the active screen).
  * Fixed a typo in same_screen

2001-01-01:
  * Some extra code removed

2000-12-30:
  * Focus newly splitted frame instead of the old one
  * Added CF_WARP_WS for perhaps nicer focusing on workspace switch
    when CF_WARP is enabled.
  * Don't map tabdrag window before moving
  * Default config: Button 1 click instead of press to switch client

2000-12-28:
  * Added a few missing 'void's
  * Makefile/path setting changes

2000-12-21:
  * Better focus handling for CF_WARP (pointer should always stay
    within boundaries of the active frame)
  * Added a word on (mouse) button bindings to the manual page.

2000-12-20:
  * Added 'close_main' for closing client main window, not possible
    transients first.
  * Colormap changing fixes

2000-12-02:
  * Resize fix

2000-11-12:
  * Added bindings-sun.conf where exit and restart are bound to
    SunF36/SunF37.
  * Correctly indicate active client with multiple screens (better
    multihead support still to be written...)

2000-11-07:
  * Automatically create ~/.ion if it does not exist when trying to
    save workspaces.

2000-11-05:
  * Added CF_WARP for warping the pointer to active frame, enable
    from config.h.

2000-11-04:
  * 'query_workspace_with' now attaches client to current frame on a
    workspace if the workspace already exists.
  * Line editor cursor positioning fix

2000-10-29:
  * Added 'switch_ws_next' and 'switch_ws_prev'

2000-10-27:
  * The functions 'scrollup_compl' and 'scrolldown_compl' are now
    just 'scrollup' and 'scrolldown' (used to scroll messages as
    well).
  * Changed 'edln_bindings' section of the config file to
    'input_bindings' as 'cancel' and the scroll functions affect
    messages as well.
  * Changed warnings in query.c be displayed on screen instead of
    stderr.
  * Added 'query_function' for calling ion functions. Only simple
    functions that have no arguments from FUNTAB_MAIN are supported.
    'query_function' is bound to Mod1+F3 in the default
    configuration.
  * Included snprintf_2.2 for implementations of asprintf and
    vasprintf on platforms that don't have them.

2000-10-24:
  * Completion list wrapping
  * Added WMessage for displaying messages

2000-10-22:
  * Do not ignore base size hint to display xterm size correctly
  * Move size information window in the middle of the frame being
    resized

2000-10-16:
  * Minor pointer focusing change

2000-10-07:
  * Fixed problem with transients not getting resized

2000-10-04:
  * Fixed problems with some programs' expectations

2000-09-09:
  * Line editor cosmetic fix

2000-09-03:
  * Added goto_previous

2000-08-31:
  * Client numbering fix

2000-08-30:
  * Initial public release

2000-08-29:
  * Added keybindings to the manual page
  * Added doc/config.txt
  * Added doc/functions.txt

2000-08-28:
  * Added kpress_waitrel-kludge to prevent accidental multiple-window
    closes
