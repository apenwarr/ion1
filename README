BUILDING AND INSTALLING

You will need a C-compiler, gnu make :-( and an editor.

    1. Edit system.mk to suit your system. If heavy modifications
       are required, you might want to save the file somewhere for
       future use (and hope that I don't change the makefile-system...).
    2. If you want to customize ion above what is possible with
       ion.conf, edit config.h (this step is optional)
    3. make depend && make. Note that 'make' here refers to gnu make
       which is usually named 'gmake' on systems with their own version
       of make.
    4. make install (not required if you manually setup configuration
       files).


NOTICE: ION WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT A PROPER CONFIGURATION FILE!

Without a configuration file no keys or mouse buttons will be bound to
any actions and you will get a  black and white color scheme.
Either personal ~/.ion/ion.conf or system-wide $(PREFIX)/etc/ion/ion.conf
must exist unless another specified on the command line.
$(PREFIX) is the path where you told to install Ion in the Makefile
and the default setting is /usr/local.

The scripts 'ion-edit' and 'ion-view' (F5 and F6 keys) expect the
program 'run-mailcap' to be found. This program opens a viewer/editor
for a file based on its mime-type. Most likely you don't have it, but
any other similar program (or just plain old text editor) will do as
well - just modify the scripts. Unless you don't want to use them,
of course. If you want to use run-mailcap, it can be found at
<http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/net/mime-support.html>
(as .tar.gz as well).



CONFIGURATION

Have a look at doc/config.txt and the default configuration files.
If you do nothing else, you may at least want to change term_font
from the default 7x13 to whatever font you use in xterm and such.
Ion takes the units by which it resizes frames from this font.
